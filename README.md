# feedback-ui
 An application using react that allows a user to leave a review on a product by leaving a comment and a rating out of 10.
 This application taught me a lot more about state and hooks, another important concept I learned from this project came from using the context API and how important that will become when creating bigger projects in the future. I also learned a lot more about how to structure React projects. Overall this project helped me further solidify key react concepts like props, state, forms, lists and keys. While also teaching me more about the importance of structure and how much easier it is to use context API rather than passing props down the whole project tree.

 
 this project is deployed through Netlify and the link is below
